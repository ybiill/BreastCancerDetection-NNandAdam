## Introduction
Breast cancer is a critical health issue, and early detection significantly improves the chances of successful treatment. This project aims to enhance breast cancer detection in ultrasound images using Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) feature extraction and ADAM optimization.

## Features
- **GLCM Feature Extraction**: Utilizes texture analysis to extract meaningful features from ultrasound images.
- **ADAM Optimization**: Employs the ADAM optimization algorithm to improve the accuracy of the classification model.
- **Python Implementation**: Developed using Python, ensuring ease of use and integration with other scientific libraries.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Provides interactive notebooks for detailed analysis and visualization.

## Result
Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in the accuracy of breast cancer detection in ultrasound images. Detailed results and analysis can be found in the results directory.
